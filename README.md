  # Parse Tree
</div>

## Project purpose
To try to find a way to build and evaluate a parse tree if the expression has no parentheses at all.

## Main points
First converted the given infix expression to a postfix one, postfix cancels this using precedence as it encodes the operation from the new way itâ€™s written, with no need of parenthesis.

If we encounter any arithmetic operators, we create a new binary tree with a root equals to this operator and then we pop twice from the stack to right and left children respectively push this tree to a Stack.

If we encounter operands , we create a new binary tree with a root equals to those operands and push this tree to a Stack.
